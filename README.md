Concurrency is one of the main skills an iOS Developer should have. This project aims to practice this topic with Swift by taking advantage of NASA's APOD API making an iOS 17 iPhone App where you can choose a date and see the astrological picture of the day.

## Usage

Using AstroPic is very simple and easy. Let's do a walkthrough of the app.

### Step One: Getting the Picture of the Day

By default, AstroPic will get the picture of the day for you. The date of the picture will follow the `UTC` timezone.

</div>

### Step Two: Getting the Picture of a Past Date

If you would like to see the picture of another date, you can tap the calendar at the top right to change the date. AstroPic will give you the new information for that date in a couple of seconds.
